## CodeClub intro

### Intro round

### Course basics

- goals, methods, topics
  - 2 sessions per week (Mon-Wed)
  - homework (posted on Slack)
  - discussions on Slack  
- guest lecturers
- suggested reading, suggested prep time

- not a bootcamp, no obligations, no guarantees
- can promise to teach the basics of Python
- read a lot of realpython.com


### Python

What is a program?
topics: code, whitespace, comments, errors in Python

A program is a collection of instructions - we instruct the computer what to do, and it does exactly that. It does **exactly** what we tell it.
A program is executed line by line, one afer another, starting from the first line of a file. The "syntax" of a program follows a strict set of rules that the computer can understand
Python is one of many programming languages. It's very popular in many areas: 
- web development, 
- scientific computing, 
- bioinformatics (a straind of DNA as a sequence of characters)
- finance (financial analysis, stock trading)
- machine learning (image recognition)
- data science
- recommendation engines
- natural language processing (sentiment analysis, etc)
- gaming

A special program, called the interpreter, reads and executes our Python code.
Python code is written into files ending with .py.

This text you are reading now is valid Python code (although it is a comment, or more specifically a docstring)
"""
```

Code looks like this:

```
cat = 'Jones'

def meow():
    # indentation is the usage of spaces or tabs to create a function "body"
    print('Meow!!!')

meow()

# Lines starting with # are comments
# These are not evaluated
# cica2 = "Mircike"
# asdasda zxcasda. 1q23123asda

def woof():  # Comments can be written inline, next to the code
    pass


def multiply_by_two(number):
    return number * 2

result = multiply_by_two(6)

"""
Lines between three quotation marks (") are comments too
These can be multi-line

Like this
"""

# Data types
# type()
# int, float, boolean, string... etc

# Variable
## naming style and capitalisation

dog = "Wolfie"

variable_name = "value"

dog_2 = 'Mr Dog'

number_of_students = 10  # no accents in variable names

number_of_students = number_of_students + 1 
number_of_students += 1

"""
## Equality, comparison

dog == dog_2 

1 == 2

1 == 1

2 > 1

comparison operators: ==, <, >, <=, >=
